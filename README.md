# Silang
A simple and straightforward programming language

## About

People feel learning how to code is hard, and one primary reason is many programming languages have complex syntax to support versatility. This project aims to develop a "toy" compiler and a "toy" language (Silang) with a simple and straightforward syntax. For the development, we will use Python to implement the major modules of the compiler, and specifically, we will use RPly as our Lexer and Parser. Github is also used for version control, and PyCharm is our choice of IDE.
